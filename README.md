# Embedded_FRDM-KL25Z
This repository contains code used to program a FRDM-KL25Z development board. 
Each file will include the source code along with any libraries need it to run the program successfully. 
These programs were made while working through the book Embedded Systems Fundamentals by Alexander G. Dean. 
Hope this code can be useful to you and happy hacking.
